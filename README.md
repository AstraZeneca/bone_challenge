# MiceBoneChallenge: Micro-CT public dataset and six solutions for automatic growth plate detection in micro-CT mice bone scans


The repository has the source code for 6 solutions for detecting the growth plate plane index (GPPI) in 3D micro-CT mice bones.

The approaches were developed as part of internal computer vision challenge.

The code has both training scripts as well as scripts for the inference using the pretrained solutions.

The approaches per team are in ..`/approaches/teamname`

The six approaches are from the following teams:
  - `SafetyNNet` or SN team [[description](approaches/safetynnet/README.md)][[code](approaches/safetynnet/)][[model](models.md)];
  - `Matterhorn` or MH team [[description](approaches/matterhorn/README.md)][[code](approaches/matterhorn/)][[model](models.md)];
  - `Exploding Kittens` or EK team [[description](approaches/explodingkittens/README.md)][[code](approaches/explodingkittens/)][[model](models.md)];
  - `Code Warriors 2`or CW team [[description](approaches/code-warriors2/README.md)][[code](approaches/code-warriors2/)][[model](models.md)];
  - `Subvisible` or SV team [[description](approaches/subvisible/README.md)][[code](approaches/subvisible/)][[model](models.md)];
  - `Byte me if you can` or BM team [[description](approaches/bytemeifyoucan/README.md)][[code](approaches/bytemeifyoucan/)][[model](models.md)];

We will also release all training and test data to facilitate reproducibility and farther development.
