# MiceBoneChallenge: Micro-CT public dataset and six solutions for automatic growth plate detection in micro-CT mice bone scans


The repository has the source code for 6 solutions for detecting the growth plate plane index (GPPI) in 3D micro-CT mice bones.

The code has both training scripts as well as scripts for the inference using the pretrained solutions.

The approaches per team are in ../approaches/teamname

The main purpose of the code is to support the submitted CVPR paper

We will also release all training and test data to facilitate reproducibility and farther development.
