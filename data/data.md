## A comprehensive, high-quality 3D Î¼CT bone imaging dataset from 83 mice, including growth plate plane annotations by radiologists.

For the review, we share a single 3D bone scan `f27da128ab.nii`, this is one of the images from the test set as well as one of the images that we used for presenting both quantitative and qualitative results in Figure 4 in the paper.

If the paper is accepted, then we share publicly all 83 annotated 3D bones for further development and benchmark by the computer vision community.
