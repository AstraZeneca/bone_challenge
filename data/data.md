## A comprehensive, high-quality 3D Î¼CT bone imaging dataset from 83 mice, including growth plate plane annotations by radiologists.

For the review, we share a single 3D bone scan `8e1d52d735.nii`, this is one of the images from the train set.

If the paper is accepted, then we share publicly all 83 annotated 3D bones for further development and benchmark by the computer vision community.
